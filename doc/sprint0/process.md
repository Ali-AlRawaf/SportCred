#### How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
We used a Facebook group chat to plan meeting times, and to decide on the tools we would be using for our project. We did this to keep a clear concise record of our decisions and the reasoning to back our decisions. To discuss sprint tasks, we use discord. We have a joint Figma account where everyone can work on their assigned tasks in building the UI. Additionally, we made notes during each team meeting in a google doc which contains important details such as distribution of work, grey areas which need clarification from the client, etc. __The following is how we divided the work for this phase:__

__Summary__: Done by Yousuf<br>
__Competition__: Done Kenneth and Mohamed<br>
__Product backlog__: Team effort - everyone worked on this task together during a team meeting<br>
**Done**: Done by Justin<br>
__Personas__: Done by Anirudha, Ali and Mohamed<br>
__Process__: Done by Danny<br>
__User Experience__: Team effort - everyone worked on this task together using a joined account on Figma<br>


#### How did you make decisions?
When making any type of decision, we have an open-ended chat. We research and list out potential options, then discuss which option we think is best. We voice our concerns with each option and attempt to find a way to address those concerns. After all our concerns have been addressed, we run a poll to figure out which option the team liked best. 

#### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
We discussed and decided upon this in a group meeting. We analysed each user story and agreed upon the best way to set the building blocks for the application while taking the clientâ€™s needs into consideration at the same time. It was stated by the client that the users should be the first focus of the application which is why we have decided to implement user signup and logins to start off and then coordinate with the client on what they would like done next. Additionally, we created polls to make sure all decisions are based on majority vote. The following lists how we assigned the priority of each of the user stories. __Please note that the full user stories are available on JIRA.__

#### Did you meet in person or online?
We met online because of the pandemic.

#### How frequently did you meet?
Our group chat is used daily. Our main meetings take place 2-3 times a week where we go in depth about work-distribution, discuss what needs to be done and so on. However, we do hold short daily scrum meetings just to make sure everyone is on track and if anyone has run into any obstacles and needs help in overcoming the same.

#### What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
One lesson we are taking forward to the next phase is that we will have our first meeting of each phase at the beginning of the phase. That way we can organize ourselves at the earliest possible point and give everyone maximum time to work on our assigned tasks.
